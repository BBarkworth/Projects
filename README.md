# Projects
A collection of some of the smaller personal projects that I have created.

### Consecutive Numbers
This program loops through a list of provided numbers and adds together any consecutive numbers that are of the same value before returning a list with those values alongside any values that weren't summed. For example, `[1,2,2,2,4,4,3]` would return `[1,6,8,3]`.

### FizzBuzz
A simple program for the famous game where any number divisible by 3 is replaced with 'Fizz', any number divisible by 5 is replaced with 'Buzz', and any numbers divisible by both is replaced with 'FizzBuzz'.

### Leap Year
A program that calculates whether a year is a leap year.

### Sweepstake
A simulated draw for the 2022 World Cup, although the csv data could be replaced with another tournament. The draw is split across multiple pots based on the seedings for the World Cup group stage draw to ensure that each person receives teams of roughly the same level of ability rather than a completely randomd draw. It's limited to a maximum of eight people in the draw.
